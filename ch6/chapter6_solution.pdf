We took one pill from bottle 1, 2 pills from bottle 2 , 3 pills from bottle3...., and weight this pills,
suppose the final weight is w. If all the pills have weight 1, then w should be 210g, the difference
of w and 210 times 10 should be the index of the bottle that has pills of weight 1.1g.

Suppose p is the probability of making a hoop, then the probabilities of winning the games are
game 1 :p
game 2: 3*(1-p)*p^2 + p^3
From the representation we can calculate and find that when p<0.5 we choose game 1, and
when p>0.5 we choose game 2.
3. There is no such solution that could fill the board with 31 dominos.
If we assign squares in the board with color black and white and no adjacent squares will have
the same color. As each dominos covers adjacent squares, then each dominos will cover one
black and one white. But the squares in the diagonal opposite corners have the same colors and
they are cut, so the total number of black and the total number of white is different, so we can
not cover them with dominos.

If the first ants randomly select a path, then to avoid collision, the rest two ants only have one
choice of sides to go. And as the choice of direction is random, so the possibility of collision is
1-1/2*1/2=3/4
For n-vertex polygon, the probability is 1-1/2^(n-1);

1. full the 5 quart jug
2. full the 3 quart jug with water from the 5 quart jug. After that, there is 2 quart water in the 5
quart jug
3. empty the 3 quart jug, and pour the water in the 5 quart jug to the 3 quart jug. Now the 5
quart jug is empty, and 3 quart jug has 2 quart water
4.full the 5 quart jug
5. pour water from 5 quart jug to the 3 quart jug until the latter is full, then the water remains in
the 5 quart jug is 4 quart

First we consider some simple situation
(1) If there is one blue-eyed person, he will notice that no other people has blue eyed and leave
on the first day. So in this case it takes one day
(2)If there is two blue-eyed person, the two will find there is one blue eyed person and neither
of them will leave on the first day. Then in the next day, they find that the blue eyed person did
not leave, so there is at least two blue eyed person, and they only sees one, so they will know
that they are the one, and both of them will leave on the second day. So in this case it takes two
day.
(3) If there is 3 blue-eyed person, the blue-eyed person will see two blue-eyed person, and on
the second day, no one leave, then they will notice that there is more than 2 blue-eyed person,
so himself is the blue-eyed person, then all of them will leave on the third day.
Suppose f(n) is the number of date it take for all blue eyed people leave when the number of
them is n.
From the previous reasoning , if there is n blue eyed people, after f(n-1) they will find that no
one leaves, then they will realize the they are blue eyed and leave on the date f(n-1)+1
and f(1)=1, So f(n)=n.

In one family, they will have one girl, and the probability of they to have n boys is 1/2^(n+1),
so the expectation of numbers of boys they have is
Σ k ∗ (
1
2i+1)
∞
k=0
To simulate this value we use
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
int k=1000000;
double factor=0.5;
double number=0;
for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
number=number+i*factor;
factor=factor/(double)2;
}
System.out.println(number);
}
we find that we k is bigger, the number is closer to 1, so the gender ratio in
the new generation should be 1.

A well balanced system should be one that make the sum of drop time of egg 1
and 2 the same. So we should reduce the number of drop egg 1 by 1 every time.
For this reason the longest number of step x should meet
x+(x-1)+(x-2)+...+1=100, so x should be 14.
9.
Suppose each locker have a index from 1 to 100. Then the number of toggles
each locker goes through will depend on the number of factors that they have.
The locker that has odd number of factors will be open.
If index n=i*j, when i!=j, the number of factors will increase by two, but if
n=k*k, then number of factors will increase by 1. This means that when a index
is a square of a interger, then if would have odd number of factor.
And from 1 to 100, there is 10 square number, so there should be 10 lockers
open.

As it takes 7 days to get a test result, in every experiment, we should use as
many test strip as possible.
My solution is that:
1 On the first round of experiment, we combine sodas from bottle 1~100,
200~300,...,900~1000 together, and use the 10 strip to test the soda, then we
will find 100 bottles that contains the poisonous one.
This step takes 7 days, and we now have 9 strips
2. Suppose the poisonous soda is in 0~100, then we combine sodas from bottle
0~11, 12~22, 89~100, and use 9 strip to test the soda, and find the 11~12
bottles than contains the poisonous one
This step takes 7 days, and we now have 8 strips
3 Then we do the same with the rest strips and bottles, in the worst case, we
need to do two round of the test for 0~8 and 9~11.
So in this solution in the worst case, it takes 4 weeks to find the poisonous
bottle.
